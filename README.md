### User Story

AS A User  
I WANT to be able to view my entire employee directory at once    
SO THAT I have quick access to their information  

### Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

### Features

1. The employee details are easily viewable in a table format.
2. The employees' can be filtered by either their First Name or Last Name.
3. The employee directory by default is sorted by employees' years of services.
4. The employee directory can be sorted ascending or descending by employee names.

### Experience

It was a challenge to figure out how the function components and class components work and how the props get passed and how to segregate different components. Table sorting also was a challenge in particular.
